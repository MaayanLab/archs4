<h1>Saving a Report</h1>
<p>
In addition to providing an interactive report FastQC also
has the option to create an HTML version of this report
for a more permanent record.  This HTML report can also
be generated directly by running FastQC in non-interactive
mode.
</p>
<p>
To create a report simply select File &gt Save Report from
the main menu.  By default a report will be created using
the name of the fastq file with _fastqc.html appended to the
end.  The report will be created for whichever file tab
was active when the menu option was selected.
</p>
<p>
The HTML file which is saved is a self-contained document with
all of the graphs embedded into it, so you can distribute this
single file.  Alongside the HTML file is a zip file (with the
same name as the HTML file, but with .zip added to the end). 
This file contains the graphs from the report as separate files
but also contains data files which are designed to be easily 
parsed to allow for a more detailed and automated evauation of 
the raw data on which the QC report is built.
