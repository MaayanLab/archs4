<h1>Per Sequence Quality Scores</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
The per sequence quality score report allows you to see if a subset
of your sequences have universally low quality values.  It is often
the case that a subset of sequences will have universally poor quality,
often because they are poorly imaged (on the edge of the field of view
etc), however these should represent only a small percentage of the total
sequences.

<p>
If a significant proportion of the sequences in a run have overall low
quality then this could indicate some kind of systematic problem - possibly
with just part of the run (for example one end of a flowcell).
</p>

<p>
Results from this module will not be displayed if your input is a BAM/SAM
file in which quality scores have not been recorded.

<h2>Warning</h2>
<p>
A warning is raised if the most frequently observed mean quality is below 27 -
this equates to a 0.2% error rate.
</p>

<h2>Failure</h2>
<p>
An error is raised if the most frequently observed mean quality is below 20 -
this equates to a 1% error rate.
</p>

<h2>Common reasons for warnings</h2>
<p>
This module is generally fairly robust and errors here usually indicate a general
loss of quality within a run.  For long runs this may be alleviated through quality
trimming.  If a bi-modal, or complex distribution is seen then the results should
be evaluated in concert with the per-tile qualities (if available) since this might
indicate the reason for the loss in quality of a subset of sequences.
