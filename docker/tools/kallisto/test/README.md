# test data set

Here you will find a small test data set to ensure that kallisto is working properly. The contents are:

- `transcripts.fasta.gz`: a gzip compressed transcriptome
- `reads_X.fastq.gz`: gzip compressed "left" and "right" reads
- `Snakefile`: a sample [`snakemake`](https://bitbucket.org/johanneskoester/snakemake/wiki/Home) file (not required for running kallisto)
